## The New Work Times 

## Part 1 - Introduction 

Hello, world. I am Victor and this is The New Work Times. My final project  to finish the CS50 course at Harvard University.

## Part 2 - Development Tools 

The whole project was created with `HTML, CSS and JavaScript`. And I also used  the `Bootstrap Framework`, to create components and stylize the project. 

## Part 3 - About the Project Name 

The name, as you can see, is a parody of `The New York Times newspaper`. The  whole Project was created to refer to a newspaper page, to bring this concept of  a newspaper into the project itself.

## Part 4 - Mini Calendar 

Now, I will introduce a little bit of the project to you. 
In this first Card we have a mini calendar. Here we have the day of the week, the  month, the day of the month and the year. The time is according to the time of  your machine. And here he is polite.... He says good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Depending on what time  it is. 

## Part 5 –The Pomodoro Technique 

`Leave a TimeLapse running during presentation showing him working.`

Here we have the pomodoro technique, which is a productivity technique, where  you do a certain exercise for twenty-five minutes and when you finish, you take a  short break of five minutes and after a cycle that repeats four times, you take a  longer break of ten minutes. Here we also have settings, where the person can  set according to their need, for example thirty minutes, seven minutes a short  break and fifteen minutes a longer break. Here we give Auto Start for at the end  of each time it automatically goes to the next session, and here we set the volume  of the audible alarm, we save and it already changes automatically. 

## Part 6 - Newspapers 

In this third card we have some newspapers, actually the inspiration came  because of the lab 10 that we had during the course. I didn't know what to put  here and that's where the idea of putting the main newspapers came up, to keep  the person updated with reliable sources of information. That's also why the name `The New Work Times` came up, so the idea is that when the person has a short  break or a long break, if he wants to be up to date with the news, he just has to click on any of the newspapers, he will be directed to the newspaper of his  newspaper of the person's preference. 

## Part 7 – Tasks 

Right here below we have the `Tasks` field, which is basically a notepad where the person will write down the activities that he has to do during the day. Clicking on this button it opens a `modal` and here we can add a note, for example: `2 pm - lecture CS50.`
And it already appears here. I'll give another example: `4:00 PM - lecture exercise.` And it already appears here. All the notes are saved in your browser's  `localStorage`. Here it gives all the settings, the title, the text and the id of this note.

## Part 8 - conclusion 

This is the Project! I chose to do it this way because of the difficulty level. This  mini calendar has a reasonable difficulty level. 
The pomodoro is a little more complex, and the Tasks field was also a little more  complex to do. 
About the slides and newspapers it was basically all done in `Bootstrap`, so it was  something simpler to do. 
I used as a research source `YouTube`, `GitHub` and `StackOverFlow` to be able to  make the conclusion of this project. 

## Part 9 - Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Professor Daivd, all the Staff Team that developed and made  this course available and that is it. This is CS50.
