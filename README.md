### üíª Project

In this first Harvard CS50 problem set, I decided to make a game inspired by anime "pokemon".

### ‚úîÔ∏èProject Requirements

- [x] Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of
      which must resemble something other than a cat.
- [x] Your project must
      have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three
      per sprite).
- [x] Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, one
      variable, and one sound.
- [x] Your project should be more complex than most of those
      demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were
      quite short) but it can be less complex than _Ivy‚Äôs Hardest
      Game_. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen
      puzzle pieces overall.
